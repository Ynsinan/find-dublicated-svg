# Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to clone and run the project on your computer.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python (3.6 or newer)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository.

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

cd <project-name>
Replace <project-name> with the name of the folder that was created when you cloned the repository.

Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment for Python projects. Run the following command to create one:

python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate
Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 5: Run the Project
Now that all dependencies are installed, you can run the project. For example, if the entry point is index.py, you would run:

bash
Copy code
python index.py
Additional Notes
If the project requires environment variables, make sure to set them up as needed.
For projects with a database, ensure you have the database setup instructions followed.
Congratulations! You should now have the project running on your local machine.
